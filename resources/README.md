For instructions on how to open up a terminal, please refer to [Opening a Terminal](#opening-a-terminal), and for help with JavaFX, please refer to [JavaFX Help](#javafx-help) in the [Support](#support) section.
3. Compile the game file code in the terminal by using this following command ```javac ./gui/OthelloGraphics.java```
4. Now, run the program using this command ```java gui.OthelloGraphics```

## Description
The game is played on an 8 x 8 board. There are two players, Player 1 and Player 2. Each player's token on the board is represented by a black and white token. The game decides which player goes first at random, and that player can click on one of the appropiate slots on the board to place their token. The player going first is Player 1 and the player will get to use the *"BLACK"* token. Tokens can only be placed adjacent to or diagonally from the opposing personâ€™s token. For example: *"BLACK"* tokens can only be placed next to or diagonally from a *"WHITE"* token and vice versa. If there are *"BLACK"* tokens that are surrounded by *"WHITE"* tokens on both sides horizontally, vertically or diagonally, the *"BLACK"* tokens then become *"WHITE"* and vice versa. The game ends when the board is filled with tokens or there are no more valid moves left. Then score is calculated by counting the number of tokens for each player.

## Support
##### Opening a Terminal
- **For Linux/Mac:** *"Right-click"* inside the window and then select *"Open in Terminal"*.
- **For Windows:** Go to the folder > press *"alt-D"* and type in *"cmd"*.

##### JavaFX Help
Your computer will not display the game window if *JavaFX* is missing from it. JavaFX should be available with Java 8 and up. It is possible that you are working with a non-Oracle version of Java, in which case it may be missing. If that is the case then, you might want to take the following steps:-
1. Download the **jfxrt.jar** file from online or this repository, and place it in the game file folder.
2. Before compiling and running the game file, run the follwing command,
- **For Linux/Mac:** ```javac -cp .:jrxrt.jar *.java```
- **For Windows:**  ```javac -cp .;jrxrt.jar *.java```

With that you should be good to compile and run the game file.

##### Logic Class Tests
Logic class Junit tests are provided to test the logical functioning of the game file classes. You can run the test class files to check the working condition of the game class files. Instrunctions on how to run Junit tests are given below:-
1. Make sure that the game class files are present together with the test class files.
2. You also need to make sure that the files **hamcrest-core-1.3.jar** and **junit-4.12.jar** are present in the same directory as the game class files and the test class files.
3. To run the tests, you will need to use the following commands,
- **For Linux/Mac:** ```javac -cp .:junit-4.12.jar:hamcrest-core-1.3.jar *.java```

followed by ```java -cp .:junit-4.12.jar:hamcrest-core-1.3.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore <name of test class>```
- **For Windows:** ```javac -cp .;junit-4.12.jar;hamcrest-core-1.3.jar *.java```

followed by ```java -cp .;junit-4.12.jar;hamcrest-core-1.3.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore <name of test class>```
